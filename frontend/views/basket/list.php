        <p>A man in Hong Kong has been re-infected with COVID-19, just a matter
             of months after he was first infected. Researchers at the University
              of Hong Kong says the 33-year-old was cleared of COVID-19 and discharged
               from hospital in April. But he tested positive again in mid-August 
               after returning from a trip to Europe. He was found to have contracted a
                different strain from the one he previously had. Despite concerns, 
                the World Health Organization says people should not to jump 
                to conclusions based on the circumstances of one patient.
